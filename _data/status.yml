    body: >
      We’ve noticed that FPS payments to and from Nationwide are taking a while to
      arrive due to a service disruption at Nationwide. Don’t worry, your payments should still
      arrive eventually. Unless your payment has been returned to your account, please don't try
      to send it again. We will continue to monitor.
